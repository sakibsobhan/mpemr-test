              Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of
              Bangladesh, assumed the office on 07 January 2019 for the fourth
              time after her party Awami League-led grand alliance won the
              December 30, 2018 11th Parliamentary elections. Sheikh Hasina, the
              Prime Minister of the Government of the People’s Republic of
              Bangladesh, assumed office on January 12, 2014 for the third time
              after the grand alliance led by her party Bangladesh Awami League
              won parliamentary election on 5th of January. She became prime
              minister for the first time on June 23, 1996 when her party
              Bangladesh Awami League acquired majority in the general election
              held on June 12, 1996. After the term, conspiracy designed by the
              then caretaker government led Bangladesh Awami League to lose the
              general election in 2001 and Sheikh Hasina became the leader of
              the opposition again. A military-backed caretaker government took
              over the office in 2007 as the BNP-Jamaat government failed to
              hand over power in a peaceful manner in 2006. After two years in
              the office, the caretaker government organized the 9th general
              election on December 29, 2008. Sheikh Hasina’s party earned a
              landslide victory with a two-third majority in the widely
              acclaimed free and fair election leading her taking over the
              office of the prime minister for the second time on January 6,
              2009. Earlier, Sheikh Hasina played a crucial role in establishing
              democracy in the country when she won from three constituencies in
              the parliamentary election in 1986 and was elected leader of the
              opposition. Following the election of 1986, a constitutional
              process began in the country ending the martial law. She led the
              historic mass movement in 1990 that toppled the government of
              Ershad who resigned on December 6, 1990. Following the election in
              1991, Sheikh Hasina became leader of the opposition in the
              country's 5th parliament. She steered all the political parties
              towards changing the presidential system of government into a
              parliamentary one. Sheikh Hasina initiated a mass movement against
              the voter-less election by BNP in 1996 and forced the government
              of Khaleda Zia to quit power on March 30, 1996. Sheikh Hasina is a
              staunch crusader against fundamentalism, militancy and terrorism.
              Assuming the office on January 6 in 2009, her government enacted
              laws leading to constitute the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT)
              for the trial of crimes against humanity done during the
              liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. The tribunal began the
              investigation and prosecution of the suspected war criminals and a
              number of verdicts has been given and executed. Sheikh Hasina, the
              eldest of five children of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu
              Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was born on 28 September 1947 at Tungipara
              in Gopalganj district. She graduated from the University of Dhaka
              in 1973. She has a checkered political career. She was elected
              vice president of the Students Union of the Government
              Intermediate Girl's College when she contested as a candidate from
              Students League. Later, she served as secretary and then as
              president of college unit of Student League. She was also a member
              of Students League in Dhaka University and became the secretary of
              Rokeya Hall unit. She actively participated in all mass movements
              from her student life. Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh
              Mujibur Rahman along with the members of his family was brutally
              assassinated on the fateful night of August 15, 1975. Sheikh
              Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana were the only
              survivors as they were in West Germany at that time. Later, she
              went to the United Kingdom from where she started movement against
              the autocratic rule in 1980. Sheikh Hasina was unanimously elected
              as president of Bangladesh Awami League in 1981 in her absence
              while she was in forced exile. She finally returned home on May
              17, 1981 ending her six years in exile. Sheikh Hasina faced the
              wrath of the rulers on her return as she launched movement to
              restore democracy in the country. She was detained time and again,
              and at least 19 attempts were made on her life so far. The
              military government interned her for 15 days after arresting on
              February 15, 1983. She was under house arrest twice in February
              and November in 1984. Sheikh Hasina was arrested again on March 2,
              1985 and was confined for three months. She was again arrested on
              October 15, 1986 and left under house arrest for 15 days. Later,
              police arrested her on November 11, 1987 and interned for a month.
              She was detained again on February 27, 1989 and November 27, 1990.
              The military backed caretaker government arrested Sheikh Hasina on
              July 16, 2007 and confined her at a sub-jail set up on the
              parliament premises. She was released on June 11, nearly after a
              year. Notable attempts to assassinate Sheikh Hasina include firing
              by police on November 10, 1987 during a ‘gherao’ programme of the
              Secretariat. Juba League leaders Nur Hossain, Babul and Fattah
              were killed in the incident. An attempt was made to lift the car
              with a crane along with Sheikh Hasina in front of the National
              Press Club. Police opened fire targeting Sheikh Hasina and charged
              batons in front of Chittagong Court Building on January 24, 1988
              during rule of president Ershad. At least 30 leaders and workers
              of Awami League were killed in that incident. Twice she was
              targeted with gunfire while delivering speech at Laldighi Maidan.
              Her car was come under gunfire while returning from the public
              meeting at Laldighi Maidan. During BNP’s regime, Sheikh Hasina
              repeatedly confronted gun attacks. Miscreants fired on September
              11, 1991 while she was visiting a polling centre in the capital’s
              Kalabagan area. A series of gunshots hit her carriage at Ishwardi
              railway station while she was traveling by train in 1994. In 2000,
              two bombs weighing 76 kgs and 84 kgs were planted at Kotalipara
              helipad, and at her place for public meeting in a bid to kill her.
              She survived as the bombs were detected prior to her arrival. The
              gravest attempt made on Sheikh Hasina’s life was on August 21,
              2004. On the day, a dozen of Arges grenades were charged on her
              rally at Bangabandhu Avenue. Although Sheikh Hasina narrowly
              escaped, the gruesome attack left 22 leaders and workers of Awami
              League dead, including central leader Ivy Rahman. As a
              consequence, Sheikh Hasina’s hearing capability was impaired.
              Sheikh Hasina continued her struggle and remained undaunted to
              ensure people’s right to food, vote and other fundamental rights
              ignoring numerous obstacles, including threat on her life. Under
              her leadership, people of Bangladesh achieved democracy and
              freedom of speech. Bangladesh earned the dignity of a lower
              middle-income country. The country achieved tremendous success in
              socio-economic fronts during her tenure. In 1996-2001 term, Sheikh
              Hasina’s government achieved laudable successes in many fields,
              the most significant being the 30-year Ganges Water Sharing Treaty
              with India; the Peace Accord on Chittagong Hill Tracts;
              construction of Bangabandhu Bridge; and ensuring food security.
              She also introduced beneficial programme for farmers, and social
              safety nets for the distressed, landless and deprived people.
              These include allowances for distressed women, widows, disabled
              and freedom fighters; Ashrayan for the homeless and “One house-One
              farm” scheme. During her term in 2009–13, Sheikh Hasina’s
              government’s achievements included increased power production
              capacity to 13,260 MW; GDP growth over 6%; elevation of 5 crore
              people to middle-income group; resolving maritime boundary dispute
